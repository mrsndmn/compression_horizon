## ⚠️ Generated paper tables — DO NOT hand-edit

The `.tex` files in `paper/tables/` are **generated** by `scripts/paper/tables/`
(see `paper/tables/tables.sh` and the `make tables` target). They are
**overwritten on every regeneration**, so any in-place edit is silently lost.

- To change a generated table, edit its **generator** (the registry/spec in
  `scripts/paper/tables/progressive.py` or the relevant script), then regenerate:
  `python scripts/paper/tables/progressive.py --name <tab:label> --save` (or `make tables`).
- If a cell is wrong (e.g. `nan`), the cause is usually upstream data/cache, not
  the `.tex` — fix it there and regenerate.
- **`paper/tables/manual/` is the only hand-editable table directory.**

A `PreToolUse` hook (`.claude/hooks/block_paper_tables_edit.py`, wired in
`.claude/settings.json`) enforces this: `Edit`/`Write`/`NotebookEdit` to
`paper/tables/` (outside `manual/`) are denied. Regeneration via scripts
(`Bash`) is unaffected.

`paper/lint_paper.py` also fails if any rendered table still contains a `nan`.
